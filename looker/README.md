## Components

### Models (`models/`)
- **`marketing_metrics.model.lkml`** - Main marketing metrics model
  - Defines data groups and caching
  - Includes all views and explores
  - Configures connection settings

### Explores (`explores/`)
- **`campaign_analysis.explore.lkml`** - Campaign performance analysis
  - Advanced filtering options
  - Cohort analysis measures
  - Time-based dimensions

### Dashboards (`dashboards/`)
- **`marketing_executive_dashboard.json`** - Executive-level dashboard
  - Key performance indicators
  - Campaign performance charts
  - Channel breakdown analysis

## Key Features

### Marketing Metrics Model
- **Data Groups**: Configurable caching with 1-hour max age
- **Explores**: Campaign analysis with multiple joins
- **Measures**: Conversion rates, open rates, performance scores
- **Dimensions**: Time-based, campaign, and channel dimensions

### Advanced Analytics
- **Cohort Analysis**: Retention rate calculations
- **Performance Scoring**: Weighted performance metrics
- **Time Analysis**: Day of week, hour of day dimensions
- **Growth Metrics**: Week-over-week growth rates

### Dashboard Features
- **Real-time Updates**: 5-minute refresh intervals
- **Interactive Filters**: Date range, campaign, channel filters
- **Multiple Visualizations**: Charts, tables, single values
- **Executive Summary**: High-level KPIs and trends

## Usage

### Model Development
1. Define data groups for caching
2. Create views for data sources
3. Build explores with joins and measures
4. Test with sample data

### Dashboard Creation
1. Design dashboard layout
2. Configure data sources
3. Set up filters and parameters
4. Test and validate metrics

### Permission Management
1. Define user roles
2. Set access levels
3. Configure data restrictions
4. Test access controls

## Best Practices

### LookML Development
- Use descriptive names and labels
- Document complex calculations
- Follow naming conventions
- Test thoroughly before deployment

### Performance Optimization
- Configure appropriate data groups
- Use efficient SQL patterns
- Optimize joins and filters
- Monitor query performance

### Security
- Implement proper access controls
- Use data restrictions where needed
- Audit user access regularly
- Follow data governance policies

## Integration

### Data Sources
- **Snowflake**: Primary data warehouse
- **DBT**: Transformed data models
- **Airflow**: Data pipeline orchestration

### Monitoring
- **Grafana**: Dashboard performance metrics
- **Prometheus**: Query execution monitoring
- **Alerts**: Performance and error notifications
