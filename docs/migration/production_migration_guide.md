## Migration Strategies

### 1. Big Bang Migration
**When to Use**: Small, self-contained systems
**Pros**: Simple, complete cutover
**Cons**: High risk, difficult rollback

### 2. Phased Migration
**When to Use**: Large, complex systems
**Pros**: Lower risk, gradual transition
**Cons**: Longer timeline, complexity

### 3. Blue-Green Migration
**When to Use**: High-availability requirements
**Pros**: Zero downtime, easy rollback
**Cons**: Resource intensive, complex

### 4. Canary Migration
**When to Use**: Gradual rollout needed
**Pros**: Risk mitigation, gradual validation
**Cons**: Complex monitoring, longer timeline

## Environment Mapping

### Development → Staging
```yaml
# Environment configuration
development:
  snowflake_warehouse: "dev_warehouse"
  airflow_environment: "dev"
  monitoring_level: "basic"

staging:
  snowflake_warehouse: "staging_warehouse"
  airflow_environment: "staging"
  monitoring_level: "enhanced"
```

### Staging → Production
```yaml
# Production configuration
production:
  snowflake_warehouse: "prod_warehouse"
  airflow_environment: "production"
  monitoring_level: "comprehensive"
  security_level: "maximum"
```

## Data Migration

### 1. Historical Data Migration
```sql
-- Migrate historical data
INSERT INTO production.marts.fct_events
SELECT * FROM staging.marts.fct_events
WHERE date >= '2024-01-01';
```

### 2. Incremental Data Sync
```sql
-- Set up incremental sync
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK sync_events
  WAREHOUSE = prod_warehouse
  SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 */6 * * * UTC'
AS
  INSERT INTO production.marts.fct_events
  SELECT * FROM staging.marts.fct_events
  WHERE updated_at > (SELECT MAX(updated_at) FROM production.marts.fct_events);
```

### 3. Data Validation
```python
# Validate data migration
def validate_migration():
    # Compare row counts
    staging_count = get_row_count('staging.marts.fct_events')
    prod_count = get_row_count('production.marts.fct_events')
    
    assert staging_count == prod_count, "Row count mismatch"
    
    # Validate data integrity
    validate_data_quality('production.marts.fct_events')
```

## Configuration Management

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# Production environment variables
export SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT="prod-account"
export SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE="prod_warehouse"
export AIRFLOW_ENVIRONMENT="production"
export MONITORING_LEVEL="comprehensive"
```

### 2. Secrets Management
```yaml
# Kubernetes secrets
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: snowflake-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  account: <base64-encoded>
  username: <base64-encoded>
  password: <base64-encoded>
```

### 3. Configuration Files
```yaml
# Production configuration
snowflake:
  account: "prod-account"
  warehouse: "prod_warehouse"
  database: "production_db"
  schema: "marts"

airflow:
  environment: "production"
  executor: "KubernetesExecutor"
  workers: 10
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### 1. Migration Monitoring
```yaml
# Migration-specific alerts
alerts:
  - name: "Migration Data Lag"
    condition: "data_lag_hours > 2"
    severity: "warning"
    
  - name: "Migration Failure"
    condition: "migration_status == 'failed'"
    severity: "critical"
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring
```yaml
# Performance metrics
metrics:
  - name: "Query Performance"
    query: "avg(query_duration_seconds)"
    threshold: 30
    
  - name: "Data Freshness"
    query: "max(data_age_hours)"
    threshold: 6
```

### 3. Business Metrics
```yaml
# Business continuity metrics
business_metrics:
  - name: "Data Availability"
    query: "data_availability_percentage"
    threshold: 99.9
    
  - name: "Processing Time"
    query: "avg(processing_time_minutes)"
    threshold: 60
```

## Rollback Procedures

### 1. Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Stop new data processing
kubectl scale deployment airflow-scheduler --replicas=0

# Revert to previous version
git checkout previous-stable-tag
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

### 2. Data Rollback
```sql
-- Restore from backup
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE marts.fct_events AS
SELECT * FROM backup.fct_events_20241219;
```

### 3. Configuration Rollback
```bash
# Revert configuration changes
kubectl rollout undo deployment/airflow-webserver
kubectl rollout undo deployment/airflow-scheduler
```
